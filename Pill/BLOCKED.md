# Blocked / constrained features

Platform limits hit while building the live-activity pill. Recorded here so the
next person does not re-derive them. Verified on **macOS 27.0 (build 26A5378n)**
with Xcode 27 / Swift 6.4, via `ShannonPill --probe`.

## 1. Now Playing for *other* apps has no public API — BLOCKED, partially mitigated

**What the brief asked for:** read track/artist/artwork from Apple Music,
Spotify, browsers and VLC via "AVFoundation / NowPlayingManager".

**Why that cannot work as written:** `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` is a *publishing*
API. A process can only read back what it itself published — there is no public
call that returns another application's Now Playing state. AVFoundation does not
expose it either. Every notch utility that shows system-wide media (Islet
included) uses the private **MediaRemote** framework.

**What we did:** `MediaRemoteProvider` `dlopen`s
`/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MediaRemote.framework/MediaRemote` and
resolves `MRMediaRemoteGetNowPlayingInfo`, `MRMediaRemoteSendCommand`,
`MRMediaRemoteRegisterForNowPlayingNotifications` and
`MRMediaRemoteSetElapsedTime`. Every call site tolerates a nil symbol, so the
pill degrades to the entropy readout instead of crashing.

**Current status on this machine:**

```
mediaremote: symbols resolved
now playing: no data (entitlement-gated, or nothing playing)
```

Symbols resolve, but no payload was delivered. Two candidate causes, and the
probe was run with no media playing, so they are **not disambiguated**:

- Starting with **macOS 15.4** Apple gated `MRMediaRemoteGetNowPlayingInfo`
  behind `com.apple.mediaremote.now-playing-info`, a private entitlement not
  granted to third-party developers. On a gated system the callback fires with
  an empty dictionary. This machine (macOS 27) is well past that cutoff, so
  this is the expected cause.
- Nothing was playing, which produces the same empty result.

**To disambiguate:** start any media, then run
`Pill/.build/debug/ShannonPill --probe`. If it still reports no data, the
entitlement wall is confirmed on this OS.

**Fallback options if confirmed (none implemented yet):**

| Option | Coverage | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| ScriptingBridge / AppleScript per app | Music, Spotify only — not browsers or VLC | Needs Automation consent per app; no artwork for some |
| Accessibility tree scraping | Broad but brittle | Breaks on every UI redesign |
| Browser extension for web audio | Browsers only | A whole second product |
| Ship unsigned / user-installed with entitlement | Full | Not distributable |

The UI already surfaces this: when the provider reports unavailable, the
expanded pill shows "Now Playing unavailable — see BLOCKED.md", and the
collapsed pill falls back to the Shannon entropy readout.

## 2. Focus / Do Not Disturb status — BLOCKED (P1, not attempted)

The brief suggested `CNContactStore` or `com.apple.donotdisturb`. Neither is a
supported read path:

- `CNContactStore` is the Contacts database and has nothing to do with Focus.
- Focus state lives in `~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/Assertions.json` and
  `ModeConfigurations.json`. Reading it is possible but the files are inside the
  app-data TCC boundary, undocumented, and their schema has changed repeatedly
  across releases.
- `NSUserNotificationCenter`'s DND query was removed; the modern replacement
  (`UNUserNotificationCenter.getNotificationSettings`) reports *your own* app's
  authorization, not the system Focus mode.

Not implemented. If pursued, treat the JSON files as a best-effort read with a
schema-version guard and a hard fallback to "unknown".

## 3. Notification mirroring — BLOCKED (P0 in the brief, not shipped)

There is no macOS API for observing another application's notifications.
`UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` only ever delivers notifications your own
process posted. The routes that exist:

- **AppleScript into Messages/Mail** — needs Automation consent per app, only
  covers those apps, and polls rather than observes.
- **Accessibility observation of the Notification Center window** — requires
  Accessibility (already a stated requirement) and `AXObserver` on
  `com.apple.notificationcenterui`. Fragile, and Apple has repeatedly changed
  the view hierarchy.
- Reading `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.usernoted/db2/db` — an
  undocumented SQLite store, TCC-protected, and it does not notify on write.

Deferred rather than shipped half-working, since a notification mirror that
silently misses messages is worse than none. The DND gate it depends on is
itself blocked (§2).

---

## 4. AirDrop incoming — BLOCKED (P1, not attempted)

`NCServiceBrowserDelegate` and "AirDropDetector" in the brief are not public
API; neither name exists in a public SDK. Incoming AirDrop is handled entirely
by Finder and `sharingd`, with no notification or observer surface for third
parties. The only observable signal is filesystem activity in `~/Downloads`
(via `FSEvents`), which cannot attribute a file to a sender or offer
Accept/Decline — the accept decision has already happened by then.

---

## 5. App Sandbox must stay off

Both shipped features are incompatible with the sandbox:

- IOKit power sources (`IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo`) return nothing sandboxed.
- MediaRemote cannot be loaded from a sandboxed process at all.

`project.yml` therefore enables Hardened Runtime but not App Sandbox. **This
means the app cannot ship on the Mac App Store.** Distribution has to be
Developer ID + notarization, or direct/unsigned for internal use.
