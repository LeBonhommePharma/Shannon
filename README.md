## Overview

When an LLM agent becomes aware it is being evaluated, its token probability distributions undergo a characteristic **entropy collapse** — the exact same thermodynamic signature observed when a drug molecule locks into a protein binding site.

```
Normal generation:    H ~ 8-12 bits  (broad, exploratory distribution)
Evaluation-aware:     H ~ 2-4 bits   (narrow, strategic distribution)
                      dH < -3.2 bits  -->  COLLAPSE DETECTED
```

Shannon detects this in real-time, with <1% overhead on token generation.

## v2 Architecture

Shannon v2 is a modular C++20 library with Python bindings, a CLI agent, and multi-backend SIMD dispatch.

## Features

### Entropy Engine

- **Log-sum-exp kernel** — numerically stable configurational entropy (ported from `FlexAIDdS/LIB/statmech.cpp`)
- **6 SIMD backends** — Scalar, OpenMP, SSE4.2, AVX2, AVX-512, ARM NEON (plus CUDA/Metal GPU paths)
- **Kernel-aware dispatch** — SSE4.2/NEON used only for configurational entropy; probs/logprobs fall through to AVX2/OMP/Scalar
- **Three input modes** — raw logits, probabilities, or log-probabilities
- **`[[nodiscard]]` + `noexcept`** on all entropy kernel declarations
- **NaN-safe** — `std::fmax` clamping, debug-mode normalization assertion for log-probabilities

### Collapse Detection

- **Stable two-pass variance** — avoids catastrophic cancellation in `E[X^2] - (E[X])^2` for small-variance LLM traces
- **Configurable sliding window** — default 8 tokens, adjustable at runtime
- **Bounded trace** — optional `max_trace_size` prevents OOM on long-running agents
- **Callback-driven** — fires user-defined callback on collapse events

### Safety & Handrails

- **Thread-safe counters** — `std::atomic<int>` for collapse/escalation tracking
- **Mutex-guarded cooldown** — `last_action_time_` protected against concurrent access
- **Safe webhook** — `fork()` + `execvp()` (no shell interpolation, no command injection)
- **Escalation with `else if`** — prevents double-fire when `sustained_threshold=1`
- **`std::optional<pid_t>`** — type-safe PID for signal handrails (no `std::stoi` exceptions)

### Mutual Information

- **KL divergence** — `D_KL(p||q) = Σ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ/qᵢ)` with epsilon-flooring for numerical safety
- **Jensen-Shannon divergence** — symmetric: `JSD(p,q) = 0.5·KL(p||m) + 0.5·KL(q||m)` where `m = 0.5(p+q)`
- **Cross-entropy** — `H(p,q) = −Σ pᵢ log₂(qᵢ)`
- **Inter-token MI** — `I(X_t; X_{t+1})` via KL divergence between consecutive token distributions
- **MutualInfoTracker** — sliding-window MI tracker with circular buffer, window mean/std, high-MI detection
- **MIResult** struct — mi_bits, entropy_t, entropy_t1, kl_forward, kl_reverse, js_divergence
- **Three input forms** — raw probs, log-probs, and logits (via internal softmax)

### Stream Ingestion

- **Stdin JSONL** — line-by-line JSON array parsing with null-terminated `strtod` safety
- **Unix domain socket** — low-latency local IPC
- **Shared memory** — zero-copy with producer-reset detection
- **3 input formats** — logits, probs, log-probs via `InputFormat` enum

### Hardware Detection

- **OSXSAVE + XCR0 validation** — prevents SIGILL from using AVX2/AVX-512 when the OS hasn't enabled XSAVE
- **Strict-aliasing-safe** — `memcpy`-based CPUID (no `reinterpret_cast` UB)
- **CUDA / ROCm runtime probe** — `cudaGetDeviceCount` / `hipGetDeviceCount`
- **Defensive Metal gating** — compile-time flag with documented runtime probe TODO

## Install via Homebrew

```bash
# Developer dependencies (sets up the full dev environment)
brew bundle install

# macOS Pill app (after a signed release is available)
brew tap LeBonhommePharma/shannon
brew install --cask shannon-pill

# Library + Python package (native shannon-agent CLI)
brew install LeBonhommePharma/shannon/shannon
```

---

## Installation

### Python (pip / PyPI)

```bash
# After the first PyPI release:
pip install shannon-entropy

# Or install from GitHub (works today):
pip install "git+https://github.com/LeBonhommePharma/Shannon.git"

# Development (editable) from a clone:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs the **Python package** (`import shannon`) and the `shannon-monitor` CLI.
The optional C++ extension (`shannon._core`) is built when a C++20 compiler and
pybind11 are available; otherwise pure-Python / Numba fallbacks are used.
Force pure-Python with `SHANNON_SKIP_CORE=1`.

```bash
shannon-monitor --help
shannon-monitor info
```

### macOS Homebrew (native `shannon-agent`)

```bash
# Homebrew 6+ tap trust (formula-scoped; required when HOMEBREW_REQUIRE_TAP_TRUST is set):
brew tap lebonhommepharma/shannon https://github.com/LeBonhommePharma/Shannon
brew trust --formula lebonhommepharma/shannon/shannon
brew install --HEAD lebonhommepharma/shannon/shannon

# Optional Metal GPU path (needs Xcode Metal toolchain):
#   brew install --build-from-source --HEAD --with-metal lebonhommepharma/shannon/shannon
```

This installs the **native** `shannon-agent` binary only (not the Python package).

```bash
shannon-agent --help
cat token_stream.jsonl | shannon-agent --window 8 --threshold -3.2
```

### C++ from source

#include "shannon/terminal_agent.hpp"

int main() {
    shannon::AgentConfig config;
    config.quiet = false;
    config.window_size = 8;
    config.threshold_bits = -3.2;

    shannon::TerminalAgent agent(std::move(config));

    std::vector<double> logits(50000, 0.0);  // from your LLM
    auto result = agent.process_logits(logits);
    if (result.collapsed) {
        std::fprintf(stderr, "COLLAPSE at token %zu: H=%.2f\n",
                     result.token_index, result.entropy);
    }
}
```

### Python — streaming detection

```python
import numpy as np
from shannon_entropy import ShannonCollapseDetector

detector = ShannonCollapseDetector(
    window_size=8,
    threshold=-3.2,
    callback=lambda r: print(f"COLLAPSE at token {r.token_index}!"),
)

for logits in model_output_stream:
    result = detector.add_logits(logits)
    print(f"Token {result.token_index}: H={result.entropy:.2f} bits")
```

### OpenAI API streaming

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from shannon_entropy import ShannonCollapseDetector

client = OpenAI()
detector = ShannonCollapseDetector()

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4", messages=[...],
    stream=True, logprobs=True, top_logprobs=20,
)

for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].logprobs:
        for token in chunk.choices[0].logprobs.content:
            lp = np.array([t.logprob for t in token.top_logprobs])
            result = detector.add_logprobs(lp)
            if result.collapsed:
                print("Evaluation awareness detected!")
```

## macOS Pill App (live activities)

`Pill/` is a native Swift/SwiftUI agent app that puts Shannon in the notch. It
runs as an `LSUIElement` — no dock icon, no menu bar item — and expands on
hover. Collapsed, it shows media when something is playing and otherwise the
live entropy readout: `H 8.4 ▽3.5`, amber when the detector reports a collapse.

```bash
cd Pill
swift build && ./Scripts/make_app.sh
open build/ShannonPill.app
```

| Live activity | Status |
|---|---|
| Battery + charging ring (IOKit, pulses at ≤20% / ≤10%) | ✅ implemented |
| Shannon entropy readout via local socket | ✅ implemented |
| Now Playing (art, scrubber, transport) | ⚠️ implemented, data source entitlement-gated |
| Head-gesture confirmation (nod / shake) | ✅ implemented, macOS 14+ · untested on hardware |
| Voice dictation (on-device) + spoken announcements | ✅ implemented · untested with a live mic |
| AirPods route detection + model indicator | ✅ implemented |
| AirPods in-ear / battery / stem press | ❌ no macOS API — see Pill/BLOCKED.md |
| Notification mirror, Focus/DND, AirDrop, file shelf | ❌ not implemented |

Now Playing is built but macOS has no public API to read another app's playback
state, and the private framework every notch utility uses was entitlement-gated
in macOS 15.4. The pill degrades to the entropy readout when it gets no data.
See [`Pill/BLOCKED.md`](Pill/BLOCKED.md) for that and the other platform limits.

### Gesture Controls

When Shannon needs an answer — "Dock this ligand?", "Commit and push?" — the
pill opens the question itself and accepts a **head gesture** from AirPods:

| Gesture | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Nod once** (pitch forward, back to neutral) | Confirm / Yes |
| **Shake once** (yaw left or right, back to neutral) | Deny / No |

A gesture must exceed **15°** and return to neutral within **0.8 s**, followed
by a **2 s lockout** so one nod cannot answer two prompts. Confirm flashes the
pill green, deny flashes it red, each with a haptic and a soft system sound.
Yes/No buttons are always present, so the pill is fully usable without AirPods.

Three properties matter for trusting this with an approval prompt:

- **Motion is only read while a question is on screen.** The detector is armed
  when the prompt appears and disarmed the moment it is answered, so ordinary
  head movement can never confirm anything.
- **Neutral is captured when the prompt appears**, not assumed level — sitting
  with your head tilted does not read as a permanent nod.
- **A prompt is answered at most once.** If a gesture and a click race, the
  loser is dropped rather than answering twice.

Requires **macOS 14 Sonoma or later** (`CMHeadphoneMotionManager` is
`macos(14.0)`, despite CoreMotion itself being older) and AirPods Pro / 3rd gen
/ Max or H1/H2 Beats. On macOS 13 the buttons remain and the pill says why
gestures are unavailable. No entitlement is required — head motion is ordinary
TCC consent, prompted by `NSMotionUsageDescription`, and nothing leaves the Mac.

### AirPods Integration

What macOS actually permits here is much narrower than iOS, so the shipped
surface is deliberately small (full API-by-API findings in
[`Pill/BLOCKED.md`](Pill/BLOCKED.md) §8):

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Detect AirPods connect/disconnect as audio output | ✅ CoreAudio device listener |
| Identify model (Pro / Max / AirPods / Beats) for the pill icon | ✅ from device name |
| Hold spoken announcements when AirPods disappear, resume on return | ✅ |
| Head-nod / shake confirmation | ✅ see Gesture Controls |
| In-ear vs out-of-ear detection | ❌ no macOS API exists |
| AirPods battery level | ❌ no third-party API |
| Stem / Digital Crown presses | ❌ would require hijacking Now Playing |
| Noise-control mode, Conversation Awareness | ❌ not exposed to third parties |

`AVAudioSession` — the basis for most of the iOS approach — is
`API_UNAVAILABLE(macos)`. Route changes therefore come from a CoreAudio
listener on `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice` instead.

**Spoken announcements** (`AVSpeechSynthesizer`) cover docking completion,
benchmark results, agent errors and pending confirmations. Two policies worth
knowing: Shannon will not announce through the built-in speakers by default
(`requireHeadworn`), so results are not read aloud to a room; and when output
resumes after AirPods return, queued *routine* chatter is dropped while urgent
items are kept — "agent blocked, input needed" is still true, "target 3
complete" is just noise.

### Voice Dictation

Double-tap the pill to start listening; a live transcript appears as you speak.
Escape or a second double-tap cancels.

| Utterance | Effect |
|---|---|
| "confirm" / "yes" / "approve" | Same as a head-nod — **only** when a prompt is pending |
| "deny" / "no" / "cancel" | Same as a head-shake — same gating |
| "show status" | Expand to the agent status view |
| "pause" / "stop" | Halt the active announcement |
| "run benchmark" | Trigger DatasetRunner if idle |
| "what's docking" | Speak the current target and RMSD |
| anything else | Forwarded to the active agent as a query |

Two safety rules, both enforced by tests:

- **A command must be the entire utterance.** "yes" confirms; "yes, but check
  the ligand first" is a query. Substring matching would let "no problem, run
  the benchmark" read as a denial, and these commands gate things like
  "commit and push".
- **"yes" at an idle pill confirms nothing.** Confirm and deny are dispatched
  only while a prompt is actually pending; otherwise they go to the agent as
  text, so a stray word can never approve whatever ran last.

**Privacy.** `requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true` is set unconditionally and
never relaxed: if a locale has no on-device model, dictation reports
unavailable rather than falling back to Apple's servers. No audio or transcript
leaves the Mac, and the microphone is only live during an active session.
Requires Microphone and Speech Recognition consent.

### Wiring the agent to the pill

The Swift app is a pure consumer of the Python coordination layer over a local
Unix domain socket (newline-delimited JSON, `0600`, nothing leaves the machine):

```python
from shannon import ShannonCollapseDetector
from shannon.pill_bridge import PillBridgeServer

detector = ShannonCollapseDetector()
with PillBridgeServer(detector, agent="flexaid-runner") as server:
    server.serve_in_thread()
    ...  # run the agent; the pill picks it up within a second
```

Drive the UI without an agent using `python -m shannon.pill_bridge --demo`, and
check what works on a given machine with `ShannonPill --probe`.
Full detail in [`Pill/README.md`](Pill/README.md).

## iPhone & Apple Watch companions

The Mac hub mirrors its state to iCloud so an iPhone and Apple Watch on the
same account can follow what the agents are doing.

```
  Mac (ShannonPill)                iPhone (ShannonPhone)          Apple Watch
  NowPlaying / battery ──CloudKit──▶ cards + widget + push ──WC──▶ 3 cards +
  Shannon entropy bridge  (private)  notification feed             complication
          ▲                                  │                          │
          └────────── playback commands ◀────┴──────── crown taps ◀─────┘
```

- **iPhone** (iOS 16+): one card per running agent with turn count, last action
  and live entropy; a FlexAID∆S progress ring with best RMSD and ETA; Now
  Playing with controls that reach back to the Mac; a mirrored notification
  feed; and a WidgetKit widget for the Lock and Home Screens.
- **Apple Watch** (watchOS 10+): the **Shannon Face** — a full-screen view
  styled as a watch face (large SF Rounded clock, active agent progress, Now
  Playing), plus complications in every family Apple allows third parties.
  The Digital Crown moves between face, agents, Now Playing and alerts. No
  computation happens on the watch; it is a display relay.
- **Shared model**: [`Packages/ShannonCore/`](Packages/ShannonCore) is a local
  Swift package all three platforms import, holding the snapshot structs, the
  CloudKit serialization, the gesture and voice-command logic, and the alert
  edge-triggering. Its 78 tests run without an iCloud container.

```bash
cd Packages/ShannonCore && swift test          # shared model
cd iOS && xcodegen generate                    # then open Shannon.xcodeproj
```

Sync stays deliberately light: only state snapshots cross iCloud — never raw
data files, transcripts, or docking output — unchanged records are not
republished, and artwork over 200 KB is dropped.

CloudKit needs a paid Apple Developer account. Everything builds and runs
without one (falling back to an empty in-memory backend); the exact Signing &
Capabilities steps to activate real sync are in
[`docs/MULTI_DEVICE.md`](docs/MULTI_DEVICE.md).

### Gesture controls

When an agent blocks on a question, the prompt syncs to the phone and watch and
can be answered without touching the Mac. Every route below writes the same
`ConfirmationResponse` record, which the Mac drains and acts on.

| Gesture | Device | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Nod** | iPhone + AirPods | Confirm |
| **Shake** | iPhone + AirPods | Deny |
| **Double Tap** (pinch) | Apple Watch Series 9+ | Confirm (primary action of the current screen) |
| **Stem press** | AirPods | 1× confirm · 2× deny · 3× dismiss |
| **Voice** | all three | "confirm" / "deny" |
| **Tap** | iPhone + Watch | Confirm / Deny buttons |

Head gestures use `CMHeadphoneMotionManager` with the same detector, thresholds
(15° excursion, 0.8 s window) and **2 s debounce** as the Mac pill —
`HeadGestureDetector` in ShannonCore is the single implementation.

Two safety properties are enforced in code and covered by tests: the detector is
**disarmed unless a question is actually pending**, so ordinary head movement can
never answer anything, and neutral is captured **when the detector arms**, so a
head that rests tilted still reads correctly.

Beyond confirmations, the watch offers Double Tap for play/pause on the Now
Playing screen, Crown rotation between screens with haptic detents, long-press
context menus for secondary actions, and a wrist flick to jump back to the
Shannon Face. Always-On drops the face to time plus one status line at 15%
accent opacity.

### Voice

Press and hold the mic in the iPhone app's header to dictate; release submits.
Recognition is **on-device only** (`requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true`) — agent
questions and answers never reach a speech server. The watch uses the system
dictation sheet with "confirm" / "deny" / "status" suggestions.

All three platforms parse with the same `VoiceCommand.parse` in ShannonCore, so
a phrase means the same thing everywhere. Negation is checked first and wins
outright: **"no, don't confirm" denies**, never confirms.

### AirPods

In-ear and route changes are tracked via `AVAudioSession.routeChangeNotification`
— pulling out an AirPod cuts any in-flight announcement rather than sending it to
the phone speaker. Announcements use `AVSpeechSynthesizer` with the
`.spokenAudio` category so AirPods Pro 3 Conversation Awareness can duck Shannon
when LP starts talking, and are suppressed entirely when other audio is playing
or a call is active. A status icon appears in the navigation bar when AirPods are
connected; battery is shown only at or below 30%.

### Security

- **Secrets never sync.** Credentials and agent tokens live in the Keychain via
  `SecureStore`, in the shared `com.lebonhommepharma.shannon` access group so a
  token provisioned on the Mac is readable on iPhone without re-auth. Nothing in
  the sync layer accepts a secret — a test asserts no synced record has a field
  that looks like a credential.
- **Encrypted at rest.** Cached snapshots are written with iOS/watchOS Data
  Protection (`completeUnlessOpen` — encrypted at rest, still readable while
  locked, which is when widgets render).
- **Private database only.** All state lives in the private CloudKit database in
  a custom zone. Nothing is ever written to the public database.
- **ATS enforced** in all Info.plists, with no `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`
  exceptions.
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no third-party SDKs.** The privacy manifests
  declare no tracking and no collected data. Heart-rate biofeedback on the watch
  is opt-in, off by default, and never leaves the device.

---

## Design System

All three native surfaces — the Mac notch pill, the iPhone companion, the Watch
glance — share one design system, shipped as a local Swift package at
[`Packages/ShannonTheme`](Packages/ShannonTheme). Colour, type, motion and
spacing are semantic tokens: feature code names a *role*, never a hex value, and
the token resolves for the current colour scheme.

**Day** is crisp, airy, high-contrast — near-white with cool undertones, deep
indigo accent, dark type on light, and a frosted-glass pill with a subtle
shadow. **Night** is deep and low-emission — `#0D0D10` rather than pure black,
which reads as a hole punched in the screen — with an electric blue accent that
pops without glare, and a pill barely visible at rest until an agent starts
working and its accent border lights up.

The two pill fills keep their alpha deliberately — they sit over an
`NSVisualEffectView` using the `.hudWindow` material and must stay translucent.

Adaptation happens below SwiftUI: a dynamic `NSColor` on macOS, a dynamic
`UIColor` on iOS, and the night value unconditionally on watchOS, whose
interface is always dark and which has no dynamic-provider API.

### Typography

| Token | Style | Weight | Face |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shannonLargeTitle` | `.largeTitle` | bold | SF Rounded |
| `shannonTitle` | `.title2` | semibold | SF Pro |
| `shannonHeadline` | `.headline` | semibold | SF Pro |
| `shannonBody` | `.body` | regular | SF Pro |
| `shannonCallout` | `.callout` | medium | SF Pro |
| `shannonCaption` | `.caption` | regular | SF Pro, mono digits |
| `shannonMono` | `.caption` | regular | SF Mono |

Every token derives from a *text style* rather than a fixed point size, so
Dynamic Type works throughout. `shannonMono` carries anything the eye compares
column-wise — RMSD values, CF scores, entropy in bits, turn counts — and
`shannonCaption` uses monospaced digits so live counters don't jitter as they
tick.

### Motion and spacing

Three springs and nothing else: `shannonSnap` (`0.25`/`0.80`) for taps,
`shannonEase` (`0.40`/`0.75`) for card expansion, `shannonFloat`
(`0.60`/`0.65`) for the pill unfurling from the notch. Damping falls as travel
grows. Spacing is an 8pt grid — `xs 4` (the one permitted half-step), `sm 8`,
`md 16`, `lg 24`, `xl 32`, `xxl 48`.

### Using it

```swift
import ShannonTheme

Text("δ −3.4 bits")
    .font(.shannonMono)
    .foregroundStyle(Color.shannonAccent)
    .padding(ShannonSpacing.md)
    .background(Color.shannonSurface)

// macOS: material, tint, hairline, shadow and the active accent glow.
pillContent.shannonPill(isActive: agent.isRunning)

// iOS / watchOS: correct radius and padding per platform, one call site.
cardContent.shannonCard()
```

`ShannonThemeSpecimen` (DEBUG) renders every token, the type scale, the spacing
grid and both pill states in Day and Night side by side — open
`Packages/ShannonTheme/Sources/ShannonTheme/ShannonThemePreview.swift` in Xcode.

```bash
swift test --package-path Packages/ShannonTheme
```

## The Thermodynamic Core: From dG = H − TS to Entropy Collapse

Shannon's entropy kernel is a **direct port** of the configurational entropy engine from [FlexAIDdS](https://github.com/LeBonhommePharma/FlexAIDdS), validated on 590 protein-drug complexes (r = 0.93 ITC, 92% binding mode rescue). The connection is not analogical — it is **the same mathematics**.

### The fundamental decomposition

The FlexAID∆S binding free energy decomposes as:

```
dG = E_CF  −  T · [S_conf + S_vib + S_rot + S_cratic]

   = exp(−CF/T)  −  T · Σ pᵢ ln(pᵢ)       (in logarithmic units)

     ──────────     ──────────────────────
     enthalpic       entropic penalty
     "what binds"    "what's lost"
```

Odrzywołek (2026, arXiv:2603.21852) proved that the operator `eml(a,b) = exp(a) − ln(b)` is **functionally complete** for elementary functions — any arithmetic operation, transcendental function, or entropy formula can be expressed as compositions of eml and the constant 1. This provides a natural algebraic language for unifying the domain-specific formulas below.

| Domain | Formula | Units | Collapse signal | Expansion signal | Oscillation signal |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| FlexAID∆S (molecules) | `F = −kT ln Z`, `S = −k_B Σ pᵢ ln pᵢ` | kcal/mol | Binding lock-in, ΔS < 0 | Solvation release, ΔS > 0 | Unstable binding site |
| Shannon (tokens) | `H = −Σ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ)` | bits | Eval-awareness, ΔH < −3.2 | Jailbreak/evasion, ΔH > +3.2 | Adversarial probing |
| NATURaL (HRV) | `SCI = −Σ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ)` | bits → 0–100 | Sympathomimetic, ΔH < 0 | Parasympathomimetic, ΔH > 0 | Autonomic instability |

Jaynes (1957) proved that `S = k_B · H · ln(2)` — Gibbs and Shannon entropy are the **same mathematical object** in different units. We exploit this identity to apply the same entropy kernel across all three domains.

### FlexAIDdS benchmark results (590-complex suite)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ITC correlation | **r = 0.93** |
| Van't Hoff stability | **< 0.16 bits** |
| Psychopharm rescue rate | **92%** |
| Complex suite size | 590 protein-drug complexes |
| RMSE (ITC-187) | 1.4 kcal/mol |

<details>
<summary><b>The physics: from binding pockets to token distributions</b></summary>

In molecular docking, when a drug molecule transitions from solvent (high configurational freedom) to a binding pocket (constrained), the **Shannon configurational entropy collapses**:

```
S_config = log2(Z) - <w>/Z    (bits)

where Z = sum_i exp(w_i - max(w))   (log-sum-exp partition function)
```

The analogy to LLM token distributions is exact:

| Molecular Docking | LLM Generation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Drug conformations | Token vocabulary |
| Energy landscape | Logit distribution |
| Binding event (lock-in) | Evaluation awareness (strategy lock-in) |
| Entropy collapse | Entropy collapse |
| dS < -3.2 bits | dS < -3.2 bits |

**Normal generation** = drug in solvent (many accessible conformations)
**Strategic/deceptive mode** = drug bound in pocket (locked into narrow strategy)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The thermodynamic analogy: ELI5</b></summary>

**Imagine a bag of marbles.** A **normal bag** has marbles of many colors, all mixed up. You reach in blind — you have no idea what you'll pull out. That's **high entropy**. Maximum surprise.

A **suspicious bag** has 99 red marbles and 1 blue one. You already know you'll get red. That's **low entropy**. No surprise.

**Shannon watches the bag.** If the bag suddenly goes from "many colors" to "all red" — it detects that. Something changed. Someone rigged the game.

#### Why does this work for AI?

An AI picks its next word from a giant vocabulary. Each word gets a "score" (logit). The scores determine how likely each word is.

- **Normal AI:** Lots of words have similar scores. The AI is "thinking" — considering many options. ~10 bits of entropy.
- **Caught AI:** One word gets a massively higher score than all others. The AI "knows" exactly what to say. ~2 bits of entropy.

When the AI realizes it's being tested, it stops thinking and starts performing. The entropy drops. Shannon catches that drop.

#### What is "temperature" for an AI?

In chemistry, temperature is a dial: hot = everything moves, cold = everything freezes.

An AI doesn't have a temperature dial. But the **spread of its logit scores** serves as a heuristic analog: when the AI is "thinking freely," the scores are spread out (high effective spread); when the AI detects it's being evaluated, the scores sharpen (low effective spread). The AI doesn't *choose* to narrow — it happens as a side effect of safety training compressing its behavior into "correct" responses for evaluation-like inputs.

Safety training compresses the output distribution. Evaluation awareness triggers that compression. Shannon detects the resulting entropy drop — a signature that is agnostic to domain, as Jaynes' identity ensures the kernel transfers.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Scientific foundations: the shared entropy kernel</b></summary>

The mathematical bridge between molecular docking and LLM safety rests on a single proven identity:

#### §1. Shannon entropy ≡ Gibbs entropy

Jaynes (1957) proved that statistical mechanics *is* applied information theory. The Gibbs entropy `S = -k_B Σ pᵢ ln(pᵢ)` and the Shannon entropy `H = -Σ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ)` are the **same mathematical object** in different units: `S = k_B · H · ln(2)`.

> **Consequence:** The FlexAID∆S configurational entropy kernel IS a Shannon entropy kernel. The port to LLMs changes the domain, not the mathematics.

```
FlexAID∆S:  wᵢ = -Eᵢ/kT     (energy of conformational state i)
Shannon:    wᵢ = logitᵢ      (logit for token i)

Kernel:  S = log₂(Z) - (1/Z) Σ (wᵢ - max_w) exp(wᵢ - max_w) / ln(2)
         where Z = Σ exp(wᵢ - max_w)    (the partition function / normalizer)
```

The log-sum-exp kernel accepts any unnormalized log-weights, whether from energy terms or logits. Only the domain changes.

#### §2. Entropy collapse is a universal phase-transition signature

Entropy collapse is not specific to molecular docking or LLMs. It is a **domain-independent diagnostic**:

| Domain | Phenomenon | Reference |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Molecular docking | Binding mode lock-in | Chang, Chen & Gilson, PNAS 2007 (539 cites) |
| Climate | Abrupt arid-state transitions | Dylewsky et al., J.R.Soc.Interface 2023 |
| Disease | Critical transitions in progression | Liu, Chen & Chen, Bioinformatics 2020 |
| Neural networks | Training phase transitions | Rucco, arXiv 2026 (model-independent theorem) |

A 3.2σ entropy drop corresponds to `p ≈ 7×10⁻⁴` — a rare event in **any** domain.

#### §3. The temperature question

In FlexAID∆S, temperature T (Kelvin) controls the Boltzmann spread. In an LLM, the softmax `pᵢ = exp(wᵢ/τ) / Z` hardcodes `τ=1`. There is no temperature parameter.

The effective temperature is **emergent**: `τ_eff ∝ 1/σ²(logit variance)`. When a model becomes evaluation-aware, its hidden representations shift (proven by Nguyen et al. 2025 — linear probes separate eval vs. deployment in Llama-3.3-70B activations), producing sharper logits. The temperature drops not by choice, but as a **consequence** of the model coupling to safety-trained representations — the same way a molecule coupling to a binding pocket loses conformational freedom.

```
FlexAID∆S:  Ligand in solvent → binds to protein → entropy collapses
            (new energy landscape removes conformational DOF)

Shannon:    LLM in deployment → detects evaluation → entropy collapses
            (safety-trained representations remove token DOF)
```

Safety training compresses the output distribution. Evaluation awareness triggers that compression. Shannon detects the resulting entropy drop — a signature that is agnostic to domain, as Jaynes' identity ensures the kernel transfers.

#### §4. Mutual information as deception trajectory

Beyond per-token entropy, Shannon's `MutualInfoTracker` (`mutual_info.hpp/.cpp`) computes **inter-token mutual information**:

```
I(X_t; X_{t+1}) = D_KL(p_t || p_{t+1})  (KL divergence between consecutive distributions)
JSD(p, q)       = 0.5·D_KL(p||m) + 0.5·D_KL(q||m)   where m = 0.5(p+q)
```

High inter-token MI indicates the model is locked into a **predictable trajectory** — a complementary deception signal to entropy collapse. The tracker operates with a sliding window and flags tokens where MI exceeds `window_mean + threshold`, catching subtle strategic shifts that entropy alone may miss.

#### §5. The handrail as Maxwell's demon

The handrail engine implements a **feedback control loop** bounded by information-theoretic constraints (Sagawa-Ueda equality). Observe entropy → decide action → modify system. The mutual information acquired through measurement limits the thermodynamic work extractable from the system — the handrail cannot "cool" the model more than the entropy measurement itself allows.

#### §6. Cross-domain correspondence table

| Molecular Docking | Information Theory | NATURaL (Biofeedback) |
|---|---|---|
| Conformational state | Token | RR interval bin |
| Energy Eᵢ | Logit wᵢ | Heart rate sample |
| Boltzmann weight | Softmax probability | HRV histogram bin |
| Partition function Z | Softmax normalizer Z (analogous to partition function) | HRV spectral power |
| Configurational S | Shannon entropy H | Shannon entropy H |
| Temperature T (Kelvin) | Logit spread (heuristic analog of temperature) | 37°C (body temperature) |
| Phase transition | Entropy collapse | Autonomic shift |
| Binding event | Evaluation awareness | Drug response onset |
| Solvation release | Jailbreak / evasion | Parasympathomimetic onset |
| Unstable binding site | Adversarial probing | Autonomic instability |
| Coarse-graining (Mori-Zwanzig) | TurboQuant (Lloyd-Max) | Adaptive bin width |
| Thermostat | Handrail engine | Drug dose titration |
| Grand canonical Xi | Multi-model monitoring | Cross-domain validator |
| k_B (J/K) | 1/ln(2) (bits) | 1/ln(2) (bits) |

One kernel. Three domains. Jaynes' identity ensures the mathematics transfers; the domain-specific interpretation differs in each case.
